# Overview

In July 2022, I was fortunately joining Professor Y.I. Wu's research team, led the 2022-2023 university-level innovation project "Binaural Sound Source Localization Research," which was rated "Good"(Top 25%).

Since November 2022, under the joint supervision of Professor Y.I. Wu and Prof. Kainam Wong, I have primarily participated in and completed the following research projects:

**Range-Direction Beamforming for Wireless Power Transfer**

**Cylindrical Array Design to Optimize Polar-Azimuthal Direction-Finding Resolution**

**How an Acoustic Velocity-Sensorâ€™s Direction-Finding Precision is Affected by Angular Spreading of the Incident Source**
