# Overview

In July 2022, I was fortunately joining Professor Y.I. Wu's research team, led the 2022-2023 university-level innovation project "Binaural Sound Source Localization Research," which was rated "Good"(Top 25%).

Since November 2022, under the joint supervision of Professor Y.I. Wu and Prof. Kainam Wong, I have primarily participated in and completed the following research projects:

**Range-Direction Beamforming for Wireless Power Transfer**

**Cylindrical Array Design to Optimize Polar-Azimuthal Direction-Finding Resolution**

**How an Acoustic Velocity-Sensorâ€™s Direction-Finding Precision is Affected by Angular Spreading of the Incident Source**

# Range-Direction Beamforming for Wireless Power Transfer Project

We focus on one specific attenna, Frequency diverse array (FDA), which:
* Synthesis of a beam pattern that has resolution over range and direction.
* With frequency offset at each antenna of the array.

Our objective is to optimize the weight vector and frequency offset for wireless power transfer to a specific position. This optimization is particularly beneficial for near-field wireless transfer applications, such as smartphone charging.

- The signal of the \(n\)th antenna:

  \[
  s_n(t) = b_n^* e^{j2\pi f_n t} w(0, T)
  \]

- The frequency of the \(n\)th antenna:

  \[
  f_n := f_c + \Delta f_n^{(f)}, \quad \forall n = 0, 1, \ldots, N-1
  \]
